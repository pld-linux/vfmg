ISSUES:
- AfterStep doesn't shrink icons (e.g. bigger png ones) - it looks funny;)

TODO:
- promotions
- moving submenus before programs within menu
- stripping 1st level menu
- adding .xpm extension the same way, as .png is
- old style afterstep menu
- locate the slowest part
- make use of XDG_{CONFIG,DATA}_{DIRS,HOME} env. variables
- support for the rest of tags (vfmg -t)
